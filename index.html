        Due to COVID-19 and the uncertainty of the University of Alberta 
        opening in the Winter 2021 semester, all Ada's Team events can be 
        assumed to operate in a virtual manner until it's officially deemed 
        safe to host in-person events.

        We respectfully acknowledge that Adaâ€™s Team is located on Treaty 6 
        territory, a traditional gathering place for diverse Indigenous peoples 
        including the Cree, Blackfoot, Metis, Nakota Sioux, Iroquois, Dene, 
        Ojibway/Saulteaux/Anishinaabe, Inuit, and many others whose histories, 
        languages, and cultures continue to influence our vibrant community.
