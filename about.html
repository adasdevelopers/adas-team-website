    <p>Our goal is to promote diversity in computing science, games, 
        technology, engineering, and mathematics. By diversity, we include 
        but are not limited to the following categories: gender, race, 
        ethnicity, religion, ability, sexuality, social class, and any
         other factor of discrimination or minority group. We embrace and 
         celebrate your differences, striving to foster an inclusive culture 
         and safe space for everyone to collaborate and thrive in.
